# Stitchbot #

This is a little tool to help me regularly scrape the daily free cross-stitch
patterns from <http://dailycrossstitch.com/>.

## Usage ##

Tested with Python 3.5. Probably works under Python 2.

Install with:

    git clone https://github.com/myersjustinc/stitchbot.git
    cd stitchbot
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run once with:

    ./stitchbot.py
